// data types in JS

// string
//number
//boolean
//bigint

//undefined  // it means the variable exists, but the definition doesnt. it might get its value in future, but the    compiler cant define it now.
//null        // null means simply empty, no it doesnt mean its --> 0 , its just null   


 // we can use typeof to check the data type of a variable

//object
//symbol  // it gurantees the uniqueness of  a variable , it cant be changed once its created.
